# Service84.IO

TODO This README needs to be reorganized.  There shoiuld be a section related to API registry publishing and consuming.  Then another related to the service implementation support libraries, like exeptional-result.

## Example Repositories
I need to add a sample repository for consuming a service definition in another service.  I am also considering if all service definitions should be published and the API first sample service should pull its definition from the central API registry.

 - [Repository to publish external service definitions](https://github.com/service84-io/external-services)
 - [API first sample service/Publish service definition](https://github.com/service84-io/external-services)
 - [Sample script/Consume service definition](https://github.com/service84-io/external-services)

## Future

 - Create a gradle plugin to wrap the opinionated server stub generation by the openapi plugin
 - Create a gradle plugin to wrap the opinionated java client generation by the openapi plugin
 - Create a gradle plugin to wrap the opinionated python client generation by the openapi plugin
